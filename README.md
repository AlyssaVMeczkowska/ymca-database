# YMCA Database Management System

This project models a comprehensive database system for a community organization like the YMCA, capturing its operations across camps, classes, volunteers, facilities, and participant management.

Developed as part of a group project for a Database Management Systems course, I led the design and implementationâ€” creating the ER diagram and writing the majority of the SQL schema, data population, and queries.
